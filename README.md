# 🎒 AI-Powered Abandoned Baggage Detection System

## 🎯 Project Overview

An intelligent surveillance system specifically designed to detect abandoned baggage and luggage in public spaces using computer vision and YOLO object detection. This system automatically identifies when bags, suitcases, or backpacks are left unattended without nearby owners, providing real-time alerts for security personnel.

## 🚨 Problem Statement

Modern security in airports, train stations, shopping malls, and other public venues requires constant vigilance for abandoned baggage - a critical security concern. Manual monitoring is:
- **Labor-intensive** and prone to human error
- **Inconsistent** across multiple camera feeds
- **Reactive** rather than proactive
- **Limited** by human attention spans

This AI-powered system provides automated, continuous monitoring with immediate alerts for suspicious abandoned items.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🔍 Core Detection Capabilities
- **Real-time Object Detection**: Uses YOLOv8 model for accurate person and baggage identification
- **Proximity Analysis**: Calculates spatial relationships between people and baggage items
- **Abandoned Item Classification**: Automatically flags bags left unattended
- **Multi-Class Support**: Detects various baggage types (suitcases, backpacks, handbags)

### 📊 Visual Indicators
- **Green Boxes**: Attended baggage (owner nearby)
- **Red Boxes**: Abandoned baggage with "ABANDONED" label
- **Person Tracking**: Individual person identification and tracking
- **Midpoint Analysis**: Precise distance calculations for proximity detection

### 🎥 Video Processing
- **Input Support**: MP4 video files from CCTV cameras
- **Output Generation**: Processed video with detection overlays
- **Frame-by-Frame Analysis**: Continuous monitoring throughout video duration
- **Configurable Thresholds**: Adjustable detection sensitivity

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### Technology Stack
- **Deep Learning Framework**: Ultralytics YOLO (YOLOv8)
- **Computer Vision**: OpenCV for video processing
- **Language**: Python 3.x
- **Environment**: Jupyter Notebook (Google Colab compatible)

### Algorithm Flow
```
Input Video → YOLO Detection → Object Classification → Proximity Analysis → Alert Generation → Output Video
```

### Detection Logic
1. **Object Detection**: YOLO identifies persons and baggage items in each frame
2. **Midpoint Calculation**: Determines center points of detected objects
3. **Distance Analysis**: Calculates spatial relationships between people and bags
4. **Abandonment Decision**: Flags bags without nearby owners (distance > person height)
5. **Visual Annotation**: Draws bounding boxes and labels on output frames
